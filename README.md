## Overview

This project analyzes tweet sentiment using machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM). Tweets were vectorized using TF-IDF, and Power BI was used for data visualization. The project investigates sentiment trends across age groups and time of day and provides insights useful for marketing and social monitoring.
